                    <b>Machine learning</b> is the study of teaching machines to learn using data, with and without human supervision.

                <p>
                    Some time ago I (<a href="https://twitter.com/ResidentMario">@residentmario</a>) decided that I needed to systematize my knowledge of the field by studying it from the ground up. I decided to use kernels to do it.

                    <b>Kernels</b> are a wonderful utility from the folks <a href="https://twitter.com/kaggle">@Kaggle</a> that provide an editable notebook environment that anyone else can then freely fork and run themselves. If you're familiar with <b>notebooks</b>, they're just like that, except on the cloud.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This microsite collects the write-ups I did into an organized, readable list. I cover material that ranges from the basic to the intermediate, starting with basic linear regression and train-test splits and ending with topics such as random forests, oversampling, and probability calibration. There are currently fifty-five notebooks in the list!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Implementations are in Python, using the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> library and friends.
